# Eportfolio
This was a midterm project assigned for my web development class at the university
This current version holds my portfolio back in 2022.
This project was a proud work of mine as it received a mark of 100%.
This prototype enabled me to think creatively, while also minding the minimalistic aesthetic I was aiming for.
Features that I enjoyed were creating the list of soft and hard skills by utilizing buttons to allow them to fit together nicely. Also, utilizing drop downs and cards to display my work experience and education.
